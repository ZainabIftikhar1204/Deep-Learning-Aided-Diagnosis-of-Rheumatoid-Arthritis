# Deep-Learning-Aided-Diagnosis-of-Rheumatoid-Arthritis
A research analysis of deep learning techniques used for detection of Rheumatoid Arthritis 

## Preface
The basic idea of this paper is to compare all the methods of machine learning and deep learning that have been applied up till now to design a system for the detection of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in patients. 

## Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid Arthritis is an auto-immune disease that targets the joints in the body. This disease mostly affects the small joints like those of hands and feet. It can progress from small problems in movement and slight pain to complete immobility and deformity in bones, greatly affecting the quality of life of those affected by it. Abot 1% of the population suffers from this disease which makes it a worthwhile cause to be worked on. 

## Why is a Deep Learning Approach Needed?
The current method for analyzing the progression of RA patient is highly subjective, time-consuming, and inefficient. The patient has to get X-rays regularly that need to be monitored by an RA expert. Due to the nature of the disease and the small considerations involved, this diagnosis cannot be done by anyone who is not properly trained. Thus, the RA specialilst has to work alone to analyze multiple scans regularly to monitor patient's condition. This process is highly subjective and involves bias of the specialist when examining the scans. This can greatly hinder the correct analysis of disease progression and in turn, the treatment for it. 
Deep Learning or more broadly, Machine Learning techniques provide for a way to design a system that is stable and can reproduce similar results without bias or inefficiency. 

## What is in this paper?
This paper will carry out an analysis of modern approaches of machine and deep learning that have been applied to develop a robust system for joint detection and monitoring of RA. It will go through 8 research papers, discuss the approaches considered, give their overview and analysis and then propose a system that can use the best of each world for best results.
